Units
- time (ms)
- length (inch)
- speed (inches/s internal ft/s external)
- accel (inches/s^2 internal ft/s^2 external)
Todo List:

Bugs:
- fix turn segments not dragging properly
- cant change coords on multiselect
- Make field visual for hovering over turn segments more visible
- Polish Control Config (segment casting)
- fix not being able to change voltage on the last turn segment 

Todo:
- Add Path constants changing, speed and lib specific constants + swing option for mik/jar
- Add setdefault button to constants
- Add units to constants
- Add file saving, loading unloading
- Fix path conversion and make a animation, also make it so if will only copy selected segments
- add ez reveilib rw lemlib jar mik vexide drive motions
- link drive motions with formats
- Fix rev boomerang (may need to swap coordinate frame)
- Fix undo/redo
- Setting menu

Planned:
- field dragging and resizing
- Add Play button to path segments on the right hand side
- Add cut, copy and paste
- Add moving segment order by dragging 
- fix UI not resizing to fit resolution
- Add scrubbing steps to settings
- square drag to select 
- add setting toggle to enable robot position view while simulating path
- add setting toggle to make it so you can step 1 frame using jl
- Mecum drive motions ☠️ (robot sim is complete)

Deciding:
- Add a segment soft delete button and add a global toggle for it as well as h keybind
- coordinate mouse hover view
- Turn command animation
- Constant Presets that save across cache sessions
- Bezier segments
- distance segments
- radial click animations
- mode in settings to enable driver control so that way you can use drive curves

Maybe:
-  Multiple paths
