Bugs:
- Fix start segment having the ability to be set to a turn by deleting segments
- cant change coords on multiselect
- Polish Control Config (segment casting)
- end point does not show up with a turn segment on top
- FIX FORMAT SWAPPING BRICKING APP
- make it so when you drag a segment the cursor goes to grab
- Fix undo redo to work on entire app data tree (still need to do commands)
- Fix rev coord math
- Fix simple stop timeout
- algos not being reset when they fuck up
- Fix file opening not working on firefox

Todo:
- Add cut, copy and paste
- add lemlib drive motions - jar template can just use mikLib with small modifications
- add indicator for unsaved path

Planned:
- grouping with button on the group to disable that part of path from sim, renaming group

- add ability to add more commands and make them be color coded, revamp command menu to not limit length and allow them to be modifed not just deleted
- change segment order by dragging, add when groups are added  
- Add scrubbing steps to settings
- square drag to select add to path config
- tooltip when hovering over svg buttons
- add setting toggle to enable robot position view while simulating path
- add setting toggle to make it so you can step 1 frame using jl
- Mecum drive motions ☠️ (robot sim is complete)
- google analytics
- make it so operators work in number input
- add example paths

Deciding:
- Add Play button to path segments on the right hand side
- coordinate mouse hover view
- Turn command animation
- Constant Presets that save across cache sessions
- Bezier segments
- distance segments
- radial click animations
- mode in settings to enable driver control so that way you can use drive curves

Maybe:
-  Multiple paths
