Bugs:
- Fix undo/redo: make it so you can undo more events and make sliders not bog up the queue
- Make it so all important events are saved in local storage

- cant change coords on multiselect
- Polish Control Config (segment casting)
- Fix start segment having the ability to be set to a turn by deleting segments
- being able to drag a control into no mans land
- end point does not show up with a turn segment on top
- FIX FORMAT SWAPPING BRICKING APP
- fix keybind names on addsegmentbutton
- make it so when you drag a segment the cursor goes to grab
- Fix undo redo to work on entire app data tree
- Fix rev coord math

Todo:
- fix rev path conversion, change keybinds so it doesn't conflict with c&p
- add lemlib drive motions - jar template can just use mikLib with small modifications
- Fix rev boomerang (may need to swap coordinate frame)
- Setting menu
- make it so field swapping isnt such ass code
- add grid snapping with ctrl + drag
- add indicator for unsaved path

Planned:
- grouping with button on the group to disable that part of path from sim, renaming group
- Add cut, copy and paste
- add ability to add more commands and make them be color coded, revamp command menu to not limit length and allow them to be modifed not just deleted
- change segment order by dragging, add when groups are added  
- Add scrubbing steps to settings
- square drag to select add to path config
- tooltip when hovering over svg buttons
- add setting toggle to enable robot position view while simulating path
- add setting toggle to make it so you can step 1 frame using jl
- Mecum drive motions ☠️ (robot sim is complete)
- google analytics
- make it so operators work in number input
- add example paths

Deciding:
- Add Play button to path segments on the right hand side
- coordinate mouse hover view
- Turn command animation
- Constant Presets that save across cache sessions
- Bezier segments
- distance segments
- radial click animations
- mode in settings to enable driver control so that way you can use drive curves

Maybe:
-  Multiple paths
