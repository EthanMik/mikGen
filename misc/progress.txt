Bugs:
- cant change coords on multiselect
- Polish Control Config (segment casting)
- Fix start segment having the ability to be set to a turn by deleting segments
- Fix undo/redo: make it so you can undo more events and make sliders not bog up the queue

Todo:
- write constants + constants config for rev gg yep sim is fucked yay
- Add file saving, loading unloading
- fix rev path conversion, change keybinds so it doesn't conflict with c&p
- add lemlib drive motions - jar template can just use mikLib with small modifications
- Fix rev boomerang (may need to swap coordinate frame)
- Setting menu
- make it so field swapping isnt such ass code

Planned:
- grouping with button on the group to disable that part of path from sim, renaming group
- field dragging and resizing (add a small home button top right corner)
- Add cut, copy and paste
- add ability to add more commands and make them be color coded, revamp command menu to not limit length and allow them to be modifed not just deleted
- change segment order by dragging, add when groups are added  
- fix UI not resizing to fit resolution
- Add scrubbing steps to settings
- square drag to select add to path config
- tooltip when hovering over svg buttons
- add setting toggle to enable robot position view while simulating path
- add setting toggle to make it so you can step 1 frame using jl
- Mecum drive motions ☠️ (robot sim is complete)

Deciding:
- Add Play button to path segments on the right hand side
- coordinate mouse hover view
- Turn command animation
- Constant Presets that save across cache sessions
- Bezier segments
- distance segments
- radial click animations
- mode in settings to enable driver control so that way you can use drive curves

Maybe:
-  Multiple paths
