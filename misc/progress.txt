Bugs:
- Polish Control Config (segment casting)
- Fix start segment having the ability to be set to a turn by deleting segments

- end point does not show up with a turn segment on top
- FIX FORMAT SWAPPING BRICKING APP
- make it so when you drag a segment the cursor goes to grab
- Fix undo redo to work on entire app data tree (still need to do commands)
- Fix file opening not working on firefox
- make it so rev coords are flipped on control config
- make it so when you drag a segment it restarts it
- make it so time change does not affect width of playback slider

- hovering segment adds to undo history
- make it so renaming group with segments inside does not reset all constants lmao
- selecting a segment does not highlight group
- added segments go inside group when added
- sim is regenerated on path updates
- make it so field swapping only adds to undo history on close (average dumbass coding)

Todo:
- add lemlib drive motions - jar template can just use mikLib with small modifications
- add indicator for unsaved path
- add ability to add more commands and make them be color coded, revamp command menu to not limit length and allow them to be modifed not just deleted
- add a play button to groups

Planned:
- saving undo history to local storage?
- grouping with button on the group to disable that part of path from sim, renaming group

- copy with merge, code leaves other auton code untouched
- square drag to select add to path config
- tooltip when hovering over svg buttons
- Mecum drive motions ☠️ (robot sim is complete)
- google analytics
- make it so operators work in number input
- add example paths

- Bezier segments
- distance segments

Deciding:
- Constant Presets that save across cache sessions
- radial click animations
- mode in settings to enable driver control so that way you can use drive curves
