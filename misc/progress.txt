Live Progess Txt

Bugs:
- Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules/.vite
- make it so when you drag a segment the cursor goes to grab, also controls do not snap to postive numbers anymore
- Fix undo redo to work on entire app data tree (still need to do commands)
- spamming R makes the path time reduce
- make the group dropping css look better
- control config not updating the path??

Todo:
- add lemlib drive motions - jar template can just use mikLib with small modifications
- add ability to add more commands and make them be color coded, revamp command menu to not limit length and allow them to be modifed not just deleted
- copy with merge, code leaves other auton code untouched
- distance segments
- make it so operators work in number input

Planned:
- tooltip when hovering over svg buttons
- collision
- make it so double clicking the eye turn off the path lines 
- square drag to select add to path config
- Mecum drive motions ☠️ (robot sim is complete)
- google analytics
- add example paths
- Bezier segments

Deciding:
- radial click animations
- mode in settings to enable driver control so that way you can use drive curves, draws a path on screen

rw notes
- heading correction is separate


command notes
- abiltiy to change colors of the command. The color appears on the robot, then disapears
- Add built in commands corrosponding to template
- commands can be double clicked to edit
- commands have color to them that matches vscode default theme
- unknown commands will be white and just called as a lambda
- paramter list to be added when commands are intialized like c++, idk how this will work for custom types
- should I use typescipt types like number instead of ints bools, etc, hmm
