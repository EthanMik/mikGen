Bugs:
- FIX FORMAT SWAPPING BRICKING APP
- make it so when you drag a segment the cursor goes to grab, also controls do not snap to postive numbers anymore
- Fix undo redo to work on entire app data tree (still need to do commands)

- sim is regenerated on path updates
- make the group dropping css look better
- optimize computed path so it doesnt update on path hovering

Todo:
- add lemlib drive motions - jar template can just use mikLib with small modifications
- add indicator for unsaved path
- add ability to add more commands and make them be color coded, revamp command menu to not limit length and allow them to be modifed not just deleted
- add a merge and copy button

Planned:
- saving undo history to local storage?
- collision???
- make it so double clicking the eye turn off the path lines 
- grouping with button on the group to disable that part of path from sim, renaming group

- copy with merge, code leaves other auton code untouched
- square drag to select add to path config
- tooltip when hovering over svg buttons
- Mecum drive motions ☠️ (robot sim is complete)
- google analytics
- make it so operators work in number input
- add example paths

- Bezier segments
- distance segments

Deciding:
- Constant Presets that save across cache sessions
- radial click animations
- mode in settings to enable driver control so that way you can use drive curves
