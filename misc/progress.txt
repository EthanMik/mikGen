Bugs:
- cant change coords on multiselect
- Polish Control Config (segment casting)
- Fix undo/redo: make it so you can undo more events and make sliders not bog up the queue

Todo:
- Add Path constants changing, speed and lib specific constants + swing option for mik/jar
- Add setdefault button to constants
- Add buttons next to slider to change direction and left/right swing 

- Add file saving, loading unloading
- fix rev path conversion, change keybinds so it doesn't conflict with c&p
- add ez reveilib rw lemlib jar mik vexide drive motions
- Fix rev boomerang (may need to swap coordinate frame)
- Setting menu
- make it so field swapping isnt such ass code

Planned:
- field dragging and resizing (add a small home button top right corner)
- Add Play button to path segments on the right hand side
- Add cut, copy and paste
- Add moving segment order by dragging 
- fix UI not resizing to fit resolution
- Add scrubbing steps to settings
- square drag to select 
- add setting toggle to enable robot position view while simulating path
- add setting toggle to make it so you can step 1 frame using jl
- Mecum drive motions ☠️ (robot sim is complete)

Deciding:
- Add a segment soft delete button and add a global toggle for it as well as h keybind
- coordinate mouse hover view
- Turn command animation
- Constant Presets that save across cache sessions
- Bezier segments
- distance segments
- radial click animations
- mode in settings to enable driver control so that way you can use drive curves

Maybe:
-  Multiple paths
